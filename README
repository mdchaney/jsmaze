These are maze generators written in JavaScript.  This includes three
different algorithms: standard recursive, drunk walk, and drunk walk
walls.

There is a fourth program (jsmaze4.html) which is a generalized maze
generator and can be used to make mazes with cells of any shape.  It is
not necessary for the cells to be of regular shape, only that every
vertex is properly marked with the walls built between them.  The code
as-is includes a standard square maze as well as a maze with triangular
cells.  The maze building algorithm is #1 - the simple depth-first
recursive algorithm.

There are some other simple maze styles that could be made.  Simple
things that come to mind are a combination of octagons and squares,
hexagons, a combination of squares and triangles (snub square tiling),
or anything else that can tile a plane.  You just have to be able to
compute every vertex and the line segments between them - basically
describe it as a graph.

All four accept xsize and ysize parameters as part of the url, i.e.
file:///Users/mdchaney/mazes/jsmaze1.html?xsize=100&ysize=75

jsmaze4.html additionally accepts many other parameters:
xsize, ysize - size of maze
solution=true - show the solution
algo=[recursive|drunk_walk] - choose an algorithm for maze generation
style=[square|triangle|hexagonal|diamond|squaretriangles|snubsquares] -
   set the style for the maze

For example:
file:///Users/mdchaney/mazes/jsmaze4.html?xsize=100&ysize=75&algo=drunk_walk&style=snubsquare

See the code if you wish to add another style or generation algorithm.

The mazes fill in with a color that ranges from bright blue to black
depending on the distance of the square from the entrance.  Note that
because we have the entrance and exits fixed at the corners, the exit
is unlikely to be the farthest point from the entrance.  The entrance is
100% blue, and the farthest point is 0% (black).


The standard recursive algorithm can be seen as follows:

1. Enter a cell, and determine an order in which to visit the other
three adjacent cells.
2. Enter each empty adjacent cell in that order and recurse.

This algorithm makes nice mazes, but there are some limitations.  It is
extremely rare that a single cell will have all four walls open, and in
fact this can happen only when a tunnel loops into a cove created by
itself.  There are other structures which cannot exist, such as two
parallel tunnels with a door between them in the middle.

Nevertheless, this algorithm is popular for its simplicity.  However, on
a normal maze of 100x75, the stack typically overflows in some browsers.
Even in Firefox you will sometimes see a stack overflow if the maze gets
too deep.

It's possible to alter the look of these mazes by changing the chances
involved with the algorithm determining the order in which the various
walls are checked within a cell.  An emphasis on trying "straight"
first, for instance, will result in mazes with longer runs.  An emphasis
on turning first will result in "tight" mazes with lots of twists and
turns.

These mazes are typically smoother than those created by the other two
algorithms.  You will see fewer "dead ends" in these mazes.  These mazes
tend to be the most aesthetically pleasing.


The drunk walk algorithm is based on the concept of drunk-walk fractals.
Instead of growing a regular fractal, though, we use the algorithm to
create a space-filling curve, i.e. a maze.  In this, segments are
created one at a time and grow randomly until they hit another segment,
at which point the two are attached and another segment started at a
random location.  This continues until all cells are filled.


The drunk walk walls algorithm is similar, but instead of growing maze
tunnels we grow the walls.  The walls are essentially the same as a
maze, too, but with the critical difference that there are two distinct
sets of walls and no "path" through them.  You can think of a maze as
two sets of walls that come up to each other but never intersect, and
the maze solution is that path that follows the edge between the two
sets of walls.


These are for your amusement or to learn more.  I hope the code is
clean enough for you to work with if you choose.  Enjoy!
